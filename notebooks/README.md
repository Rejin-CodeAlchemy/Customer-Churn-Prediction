# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebook for exploring, prototyping, and analyzing the data science project.

## Structure

- **01_data_exploration_solution.ipynb**: Initial exploration of the dataset.
- **02_data_clustering_solution.ipynb**: Clustering of the dataset.
- **03_modelling_solution.ipynb**: Model experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.
  
## Usage

1. Start with the notebooks in `01_data_exploration_solution.ipynb` for preprocessing and EDA.
2. Use `02_data_clustering_solution.ipynb` to identify the clusters within the dataset
3. Use `03_modelling_solution.ipynb` to experiment with different models, evaluate model performance and Summarize findings  

## Outputs

Check:
- `data/processed` - path for the intermediate data sheet outputs.
- `models/` - path for the imputers, models and variables
