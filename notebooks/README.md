# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for exploring, prototyping, and analyzing the data science project.

## Structure

- **01_data_exploration_solution/**: Initial exploration of the dataset.
- **02_model_prototype_solution/**: Model experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Usage

1. Start with the notebooks in `01_data_exploration_solution/` to understand the dataset.
2. Use `02_model_prototype_solution/` to experiment with different models, evaluate model performance and Summarize findings

## Notes

- Ensure all notebooks are well-documented with clear explanations and comments.
- Save intermediate results (e.g., cleaned data, trained models) in the appropriate folders (e.g., `data/processed/`, `models/`).
